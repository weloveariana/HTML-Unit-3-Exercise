// Nice! Look at you, Curious George! Glad you came poking around. As an aspiring developer,
//   curiosity and the desire for learning will be your greatest asset!

// That said, in this case, it didn't reward you all that much... we haven't covered JavaScript 
//   as of this portion of the curriculum, and that's what this file is for. Don't worry - 
//   you'll MORE than get your fill of files like this later, I promise!


// While you're here, you may notice that there are some red, wavy lines under some words - 
//   and you may be wondering why, noting that they're spelled correctly. Code editing 
//   software usually contains editor helper features which give you "suggestions" regarding 
//   your work. In many cases, they're a wonderful time savings, but in this case, they're 
//   letting us know that this file won't run the way it is. Which, frankly, we sort of 
//   knew - there's no actual active code in here, since every single line is "commented 
//   out", meaning it is preceded by the special characters that denote it as being a 
//   comment in that language.


console.log(document.documentElement.children[0].children[9]);


// Wow. Still not satisfied? Fine. Um... ok, this is all commentary. How about that? If you go 
//   to index.html where all the action is, you'll see a bunch of commentary there, too, but 
//   you may note the weird characters at the beginning and end are different from what you 
//   see here. That's because they're different languages, and each language has it's own 
//   special way to denote comments. Comments exist in every language, however, and are 
//   the best way to share important details about the code or keep track of what you're 
//   doing during development. Feel free to poke around and explore some more!
