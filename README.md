# Welcome to the code portion of the Intro to Web Dev Fundamentals Course

## Overview

Welcome to the Intro to Web Dev Fundamentals Course! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in web development concepts and skills. Throughout the curriculum, you will be directed to GitHub Classroom projects to complete coding assignments using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular code editor. This README.md file will guide you through the primary functionality and basics of using GitHub Classroom for coding practice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you're just now stumbling upon this directly through a search of repos on GitHub, may I suggest signing up for the full free course?

We have quite a bit of supporting material over in our new virtual classroom hosted on GitHub. You can check that out here:
